# MC-turtle-miner

A lua script for a Turtle in Minecraft which allows it to dig in a AxB formation for as long as the chunks are loaded.

One of my first codes ever written.


##How to use
First open up a turtle terminal. Then type in this command "pastebin get WuHYShiW <desired name for the program eg. 'miner'>". After you have downloaded the script, simply run it by typing in the name that you gave the program, if you followed my example it woudl be "miner". After the program opens, fill in the blocks that are asked (the number of blocks are asked in every direction making a shape of a cube). And thats it now you can preload chunks and have a bot do your mining.
